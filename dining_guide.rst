U-District (Conference Vicinity)
--------------------------------

The University of Washington is situated about 5 miles North of downtown
Seattle. 

**The Ave - University Way Northeast**

The closest food to Kane Hall is on University Way Northeast 
which is often referred to as The Ave. The Ave has many food options often 
marked by the cheapness and proximity to campus. 

**U Village**

Just north of UW is the U Village with several food and shopping options. 
U Village is a 0.8 mile (1.3 km) walk across campus. There are a few chain 
restaurants here but also some local options as well. The QFC here is one 
of the closest full grocery stores to campus.

Around Town
-------------------

The next two closest food areas to the University of Washington are 
Capitol Hill and Downtown Seattle. These locations might be hard to 
get there and back for lunch but could be a good place to get dinner
and/or drinks in the evening.

Both can be reached by the light rail which can be caught at the 
University of Washington Station on Montlake Blvd. This is a 
0.6 mile (1 km) walk from Kane Hall. There are also buses (48/197/271/542) 
along 15th Ave which connect to the light rail station, this includes <0.3 miles (0.5 km) 
of walking. 

The transit timetables are integrated into the popular map apps, such as Google Maps.
There is also the One Bus Away app for buses which gives you live updates
as to when the next bus is due at each bus stop.

Seattle is served by taxis as well as rideshare services such as Lyft, Uber and
ReachNow. There are also car-share services such as Car2Go and ReachNow, but
there may not be much public street parking near the University.

**Capitol Hill**

*15-20 minutes via public transit*

Historically the LGBTQ centre of Seattle, Capitol Hill has grown to be one of the most
popular nightlife areas in the city. There are many food options here as well and bars 
and other nightlife. To get to Capitol Hill via public transit you can take the light
rail and get off at the Capitol Hill Station or there might be buses that get you closer
to a particular restaurant.

**Downtown Seattle - Pike Place/Westlake Station**

*20-25 minutes via public transit*

To get to Pike Place take the light rail to Westlake Station then walk towards the 
water (lower street numbers) on Pine or Pike. There are a few sit down options here but 
mostly quick eats to grab and go. There are a variety of bars here as well but many of 
them are small so be careful bring a large group.

Westlake station has addional food and happy hour locations within walking distance. 
There are a few cocktail bars and restaurant close to the station around the shopping 
area. If you are up for a walk there are several hip bars around the Amazon Campus 
(0.3 mile/0.5 km walk from Westlake Station) or in Belltown on 1st and 2nd Ave 
(0.5 miles/0.8 km). 

**Downtown Seattle - University Station**

*20-25 minutes via public transit*

The University Station is the next stop on the light rail. It is the closest station to 
the Seattle Art Museum (SAM) and situated in the buisness district of Seattle. There are 
many fast eats that serve the downtown workforce. As well there are bars and evening 
restaurant nearby that often have happy hours. The vibe is often more upscale and serving 
to the buisness professionals after work.

**Downtown Seattle - Pioneer Square**

Pioneer Square .... Should I suggest people go here?

**Downtown Seattle - International District**

International District has a lot of great food. If you are looking for dim sum this is where 
you want to be. The area can be a bit more .... Maybe bring a larger group. I've never been messed with though.
