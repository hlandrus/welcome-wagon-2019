Around Town
-------------------

The next two closest food areas to the University of Washington are 
Capitol Hill and Downtown Seattle. These locations might be hard to 
get there and back for lunch but could be a good place to get dinner
and/or drinks in the evening.

Both can be reached by the light rail which can be caught at the 
University of Washington Station on Montlake Blvd. This is a 
0.6 mile / 1 km walk from Kane Hall. There are also buses 
(48/197/271/542) along 15th Ave which connect to the light 
rail station, this includes <0.3 miles / 0.5 km of walking. 

The transit timetables are integrated into the popular map apps, such as Google Maps.
There is also the One Bus Away app for buses which gives you live updates
as to when the next bus is due at each bus stop.

Seattle is served by taxis as well as rideshare services such as Lyft, Uber and
ReachNow. There are also car-share services such as Car2Go and ReachNow, but
street parking is limited in Capitol Hill and Downtown.
